This project enhances solar energy efficiency by integrating real-time IoT monitoring with an automated solar tracking mechanism. Using ESP32, Arduino Uno, LDR sensors, DHT11, and servo motors, the system dynamically adjusts solar panel angles to follow the sunâ€™s path while monitoring key parameters such as temperature, voltage, and current.

Key features include:

  i.Remote monitoring of solar panel performance through IoT.
  
  ii.Data-driven optimization, enabling panels to maximize energy generation.
  
  iii.Scalability and sustainability, with potential integration into smart grids and future solar expansions.
  
  iv.Environmental and societal impact, promoting renewable energy adoption and potential job creation.
  
This project demonstrates how IoT and embedded systems can be leveraged to create a cost-effective, sustainable, and intelligent solar power solution.
